In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. The dataset is of 102 flower categories (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

1. Load and preprocess the image dataset
2. Train the image classifier on the dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content
